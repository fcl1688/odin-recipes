Create a recipe website

The recipe website includes three different recipes
With a homepage named Recipes and three content pages with one dish each
The content page includes description, ingredients and steps

The goal is to get familiar with basic html elements and Git
ex: <meta>, <title>, <h1>, <p>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>
